# Vietnamese Certification Company Website Design Trends (2025)

## Color Schemes: Trust Through Psychology

### Primary Colors
- **Blue (33% adoption)**: Dominates professional cert sites. Conveys trust, reliability, stability. Essential for finance/compliance context.
- **Green**: Secondary choice for environmental/health certifications (ISO 14001, ISO 45001). Signals safety & sustainability.
- **Orange**: Emerging choice for trust + engagement blend. Vietnamese research shows orange interfaces generate higher user satisfaction than grey alternatives.
- **Grey**: Professional accent color; used for text hierarchy and backgrounds. Creates authority without overload.

### Vietnamese Cultural Consideration
Vietnamese users perceive colors through cultural lens, not universal Western interpretations. Mix international trust signals (blue) with local visual preferences (orange accent elements). Avoid over-reliance on single color psychology.

## Typography: Diacritical Mark Mastery

### Recommended Sans-Serif Fonts
- **Be Vietnam Pro**: Neo-grotesk designed for tech/corporate. Refined Vietnamese letterforms with adaptive diacritical placement.
- **Montserrat**: Modern, versatile. Wide weight range (excellent for hierarchy). Strong Vietnamese character support.
- **Sofia Pro**: 16 styles, 8 weights. Supports 223 languages including flawless Vietnamese tone marks.

### Implementation Rules
- Primary: Headlines/certifications (Be Vietnam Pro 600-700 weight)
- Body text: 14-16px minimum (Montserrat 400-500 weight)
- Ensure +2.2x spacing ratio between lines for diacritical mark clarity
- Fallback to system stack (Roboto, -apple-system) to prevent font-loading delays on cert pages

**Critical**: Improper Vietnamese font rendering damages credibility instantly. Verify tone mark placement before deployment.

## Layout Patterns: Conversion-Focused Structure

### Above-Fold Priority Sequence
1. **Trust badge/logo** (Bộ Công Thương seal or ISO mark, top-left)
2. **Value proposition** (2-3 lines max: services, speed, certifications)
3. **Primary CTA** (Registration/consultation button, high-contrast blue/green)
4. **Trust indicator hero** (Certification count, client count, or accreditation)

### Standard Page Flow
- **Header**: Navigation (Home, Services, Certifications, Contact) + Trust badges
